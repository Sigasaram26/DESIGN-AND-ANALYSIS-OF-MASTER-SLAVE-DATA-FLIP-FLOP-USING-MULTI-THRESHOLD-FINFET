# DESIGN-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-MASTER-SLAVE-DATA-FLIP-FLOP-USING-MULTI-THRESHOLD-FINFET
In this work, a multi-threshold strategy and FinFET technology are  used to build a master-slave data flip flop. Results are compared using only one  threshold master slave data flip flop. It has been demonstrated that the flip flop's static  and average electricity usage have fallen by 54% and 8.5%, respectively. 
we are designing the circuit master slave data flip flop using multi-threshold data flip-flop in microwind software. we have compared the outputs of multi-threshold and single-threshold master-slave data flip-flops using various logic gates and transistors.
