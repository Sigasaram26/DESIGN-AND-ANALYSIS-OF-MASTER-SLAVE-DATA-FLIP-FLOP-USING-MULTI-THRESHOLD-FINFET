# DESIGN-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-MASTER-SLAVE-DATA-FLIP-FLOP-USING-MULTI-THRESHOLD-FINFET
In this work, a multi-threshold strategy and FinFET technology are  used to build a master-slave data flip flop. Results are compared using only one  threshold master slave data flip flop. It has been demonstrated that the flip flop's static  and average electricity usage have fallen by 54% and 8.5%, respectively.
